# Predictive Model for Precision Medicine

Welcome to the Predictive Model for Precision Medicine repository! This project aims to develop a robust predictive model for remission prediction in psychiatric disorders, leveraging machine learning techniques such as Logistic Regression, Stratified Cross-Validation, Hyperparameter Tuning, and SHAP-based interpretability.

Overview
This repository contains code for building a machine learning pipeline that can predict remission status in patients, using a dataset that includes both clinical, demographic, and biomarker information. The model is designed with the following features:

Preprocessing Pipeline: Scales numerical features and encodes categorical features using a combination of StandardScaler and OneHotEncoder.

Cross-Validation Strategy: Utilizes StratifiedKFold for nested cross-validation, ensuring that the data is split in a balanced manner while tuning hyperparameters.

Modeling: Logistic Regression is used to predict remission status, and hyperparameters are fine-tuned via GridSearchCV.

Performance Metrics: The model's performance is evaluated based on accuracy, ROC-AUC, and other relevant metrics.

Model Interpretability: SHAP (Shapley Additive Explanations) is used to interpret the model and highlight the importance of different features.

Key Features
Data Preprocessing: Handles both numerical and categorical features with appropriate transformations.

Nested Cross-Validation: Ensures unbiased performance estimates by using an outer loop for model evaluation and an inner loop for hyperparameter tuning.

SHAP Analysis: Provides insights into the model's predictions and helps identify the most important features contributing to the outcome.

Configurable Parameters: Configuration is managed through a config.yml file for easy modification of model parameters, cross-validation settings, and preprocessing choices.

# Results
After completing the cross-validation process, the model's performance is summarized with the following metrics:

Accuracy: A measure of how well the model classifies remission versus non-remission.

ROC-AUC: A measure of the model’s ability to discriminate between classes.

Standard Deviations: To assess the model’s stability across different cross-validation folds.
